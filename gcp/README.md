If you already have one, input the Aqua license or obtain the license by filling out the form linked on the Aqua Console startup portal. You can simply reach out to us at [cloudsales@aquasec.com](mailto:cloudsales@aquasec.com) and weâ€™ll create one for you.<br /><br />

## Step 4: Scaling out Enforcers

### Within the cluster
Aqua Enforcers are deployed as a Daemonset on the GKE cluster. When you scale out your cluster or add more node-pools, the Enforcers will automatically scale out with it and get registered with the Aqua console.
