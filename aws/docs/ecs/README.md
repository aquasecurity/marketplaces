## Step 1: Subscribe on the AWS Marketplace
Before launching one of our products, you'll first need to subscribe to Aqua enterprise platform on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07KJKMNR8">AWS Marketplace.</a> Click the button below to get started:
<table>
	<tr>

	</tr>
</table>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td width="40%"><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07KJKMNR8"><img src="https://github.com/aquasecurity/marketplaces/blob/master/aws/images/aws-marketplace.png" /></a></td>

		</td>
	</tr> 
</table>

## Step 2: Configure your ECS cluster
Aqua platform can be easily launched into your existing ECS cluster or you can create a new one from the AWS console. The self-hosted Aqua platform needs at least 2 ECS instances and an ECS agent with version 1.30.0 or above. For high availability, you must deploy Aqua across 2 availability zones (AZs) and leverage a managed database solution like Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL database.

## Step 3: Launch Aqua enterprise platform using CloudFormation
<table>
	<tr>
		<td width="25%"><a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https:%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Faqua-security-public%2Faqua-security-ecs-payg.template&stackName=AquaSecurityEcsPayg"><img src="https://github.com/aquasecurity/marketplaces/blob/master/images/aqua-logo.png" width="250"/></a></td>
		<td>
			<h3>Aqua in a box</h3>
			<p>Launch Aqua platform in a new or existing EKS cluster and run your artifacts, hosts and workloads securely with Aqua. Well-suited for non-production deployments, it allows you to hit the ground running while providing a sneak peak int Aqua's full-blown cloud-native security capabilities. Architected as a microservices application, the Aqua platform is outputted as containers in the form of Kubernetes-native deployments, launched within a namespace. </p>
